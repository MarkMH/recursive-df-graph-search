This project is part of Harvardx CS50AI. It includes a concise implementation of a depth-first graph search that utilizes the concept of recursion.  The implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe is adopted from pygames.

The crucial part is the following function that retunes action-value pairs. This means an evaluation is added to each possible action, for each state of the game board. Given the state of a game board, this determines the optimal strategy for the remaining strategy space.
